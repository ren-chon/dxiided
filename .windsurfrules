- we're working on a d3d12 to d3d11 downgrade layer not the opposite
- when you propose changes to one file, do not split edits in chunks
## Goal

we are createing a downgrade layer that allows DirectX 12 games and applications to run on systems that only support DirectX 11. This project is an ambitious attempt to bridge the gap between newer games and older hardware.

## How It Works

- Implements a `d3d12.dll` that intercepts DirectX 12 API calls
- Downgrades these calls into equivalent DirectX 11 operations
- Attempts to maintain a balance between compatibility and performance

## Target Users

- Users with DirectX 11-only hardware hoping to run DirectX 12 games
- Windows systems with older GPUs seeking extended gaming possibilities

# Notes
- always analyze files before committing any changes
- always analyze file mentioned in the logs stack one by one to fix potential issues
- ask for game disassembly pesudo ghidra code analysis or assembly to understand how the target application or game is behaving
